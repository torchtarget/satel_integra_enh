# Satel Integra Enhanced: Asynchronous python client for Satel Integra

[![Licence](https://img.shields.io/github/license/c-soft/satel_integra)](LICENSE)

**This is an enhanced fork of [c-soft/satel_integra](https://github.com/c-soft/satel_integra)** that adds additional features from the Satel Integra protocol that are useful for home automation and comprehensive monitoring.

## About

Enhanced communication library for Satel Integra alarm system via TCP/IP protocol (ETHM-1/ETHM-1 Plus modules). This fork extends the original library with additional monitoring capabilities:

- **Zone temperature reading** - Monitor temperature from temperature-enabled zones
- **Zone tamper detection** - Detect physical tampering with sensors
- **System trouble monitoring** - AC power loss, battery status, communication issues
- **Zone bypass status** - Track which zones are currently bypassed
- **Alarm memory** - Historical alarm information
- **Enhanced zone states** - Long violation, no violation troubles

### Why This Fork?

The original `satel_integra` library provides excellent basic functionality for zone violation monitoring, partition arming/disarming, and output control. However, the Satel Integra protocol supports many more features that are valuable for comprehensive home monitoring:

- **Environmental monitoring** (temperature sensing)
- **Security monitoring** (tamper detection, bypass status)
- **System health** (power, battery, communication troubles)
- **Historical data** (alarm memory, trouble memory)

This fork aims to expose these additional capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility with the original library.

## Installation

### From Source (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/torchtarget/satel_integra_enh.git
cd satel_integra_enh
pip install -e .
```

### From GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/torchtarget/satel_integra_enh.git
```

## Usage

Basic usage is identical to the original library:

```python
from satel_integra import AsyncSatel

# Connect to your Satel Integra system
satel = AsyncSatel(
    host="192.168.1.100",
    port=7094,
    monitored_zones=[1, 2, 3],
    monitored_outputs=[1, 2],
    partitions=[1]
)

await satel.start(enable_monitoring=True)

# Access enhanced features
temperature = await satel.get_zone_temperature(zone_number=5)
tamper_zones = satel.zones_tamper
bypass_zones = satel.zones_bypass
```

For complete examples, look into the [examples](examples/) folder.

### Protocol Coverage

Based on the [Satel Integra INT-RS/ETHM-1 protocol](https://www.satel.eu/en/download/instrukcje/ethm1_plus_en_a1951078.pdf), this library currently implements:

**Monitoring Commands:**
- 0x00 - Zones violation ✅
- 0x01 - Zones tamper 🚧
- 0x06 - Zones bypass 🚧
- 0x09-0x16 - Partition states ✅
- 0x17 - Outputs state ✅
- 0x1A - RTC and basic status 🚧
- 0x1B-0x1F - System troubles 🚧
- 0x7D - Zone temperature ✅

**Control Commands:**
- 0x80-0x83 - Partition arming (modes 0-3) ✅
- 0x84 - Partition disarm ✅
- 0x85 - Clear alarm ✅
- 0x88-0x89 - Outputs control ✅

✅ = Implemented | 🚧 = Planned
